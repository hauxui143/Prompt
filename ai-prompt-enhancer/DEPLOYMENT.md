   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your repository
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Your app is live!**
   - Vercel will provide you with a live URL
   - Every push to main will auto-deploy

### Vercel CLI (Alternative)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod

## 📋 Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] Build passes locally (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] All components render correctly
- [ ] OpenAI API integration works
- [ ] Responsive design tested
- [ ] Environment variables configured (if needed)

## 🔧 Environment Variables

The app doesn't require server-side environment variables since users provide their OpenAI API keys directly. However, you can optionally set:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="AI Prompt Enhancer"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DESCRIPTION="Transform your prompts with AI"
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **No API keys in code**: Users provide their own OpenAI API keys
- **Client-side only**: API calls are made directly from the browser
- **No database required**: The app is stateless
- **No authentication needed**: Open for all users

## 📊 Performance Tips

1. **Enable gzip compression** on your hosting platform
2. **Use CDN** for static assets
3. **Enable caching** for better performance
4. **Monitor bundle size** with `npm run analyze`

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- API keys are never stored server-side
- All prompts are processed client-side
- No user data is logged or tracked
- HTTPS is enforced in production
