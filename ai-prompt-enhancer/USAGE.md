   - Enter your basic prompt in the "Original Prompt" field
   - Or try one of our example prompts

4. **Enhance!**
   - Click "Enhance Prompt" and watch the magic happen
   - Your enhanced prompt will appear on the right

5. **Use Your Enhanced Prompt**
   - Copy or download your enhanced prompt
   - Use it with any AI tool for better results

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### Writing Better Original Prompts

Even though the enhancer will improve your prompts, starting with a clearer base helps:

**Instead of:** "Write something about cats"
**Try:** "Write a story about a cat who saves the day"

**Instead of:** "Help me code"
**Try:** "Create a Python function that calculates compound interest"

### Understanding the Enhancement Process

The AI enhancer applies several techniques:

1. **Adds Specificity**: Makes vague requests more detailed
2. **Includes Context**: Provides relevant background information
3. **Defines Format**: Specifies how the output should be structured
4. **Sets Constraints**: Adds helpful limitations and guidelines
5. **Improves Clarity**: Removes ambiguity and unclear language

### Example Transformations

#### Creative Writing
**Original:** "Write a story about space"

**Enhanced:** 
```
Create an engaging science fiction short story (1000-1500 words) set in space. Include:

- A compelling protagonist with clear motivations
- A specific space setting (space station, alien planet, or spacecraft)
- A central conflict that drives the narrative
- Scientific elements that feel realistic
- Dialogue that reveals character and advances plot
- A satisfying resolution

Write in third person past tense with vivid descriptions that help readers visualize the setting. Target the story for young adult readers with themes of discovery and courage.
```

#### Code Generation
**Original:** "Make a sorting function"

**Enhanced:**
```
Create a robust sorting function in Python with the following specifications:

- Function name: `advanced_sort`
- Parameters: 
  - `data`: list of comparable elements
  - `algorithm`: string specifying sort type ('quick', 'merge', 'heap')
  - `reverse`: boolean for descending order (default False)
- Return: sorted list
- Include error handling for invalid inputs
- Add docstring with examples
- Implement at least 3 different sorting algorithms
- Include time complexity comments
- Write accompanying unit tests

Example usage and expected behavior should be clearly demonstrated.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### For Different Use Cases

#### **Academic/Educational**
- Specify the academic level (high school, undergraduate, graduate)
- Include the subject area and context
- Request specific formats (essay, explanation, analysis)
- Ask for citations or references when appropriate

#### **Business/Professional**
- Define the target audience
- Specify the business context and goals
- Request actionable insights or recommendations
- Include relevant metrics or KPIs

#### **Creative Projects**
- Specify the medium and format
- Define the target audience and tone
- Include genre or style preferences
- Request specific elements (characters, setting, theme)

#### **Technical/Programming**
- Specify the programming language and version
- Define the environment and dependencies
- Include performance requirements
- Request documentation and testing

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being Too Vague**: "Help me with marketing" â†’ "Create a digital marketing strategy for a B2B SaaS startup"
2. **No Context**: "Write code" â†’ "Write Python code for data analysis using pandas"
3. **Missing Constraints**: "Write a story" â†’ "Write a 500-word mystery story for teenagers"
4. **Unclear Goals**: "Analyze this" â†’ "Perform financial analysis on Q3 revenue data"

- Try generating a new API key

**"Rate limit exceeded" Error**
- You've hit OpenAI's rate limits
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan

**No Enhancement Happening**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key has sufficient credits
- Try with a simpler prompt first

**Poor Enhancement Quality**
- Try being more specific in your original prompt
- Provide more context about your intended use
- Experiment with different prompt styles

## ðŸ“ˆ Getting Better Results

### Iterative Improvement
1. Start with your enhanced prompt
2. Use it with an AI tool
3. Note what could be improved
4. Refine your original prompt
5. Enhance again for better results

### Prompt Chaining
Use enhanced prompts as starting points for follow-up prompts:
1. Generate an outline with an enhanced prompt
2. Use sections of that outline for more specific enhancements
3. Build comprehensive content step by step

### Experimentation
- Try different phrasings for the same concept
- Test various levels of detail
- Experiment with different constraints
- Compare results across multiple enhancements
